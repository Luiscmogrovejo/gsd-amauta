## Security rules

- Parameterized SQL — never string concatenation
- Sanitize and validate ALL user input
- Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Use HTTPS for all external calls
- Proper error handling (never expose stack traces)
- Escape output in templates (XSS prevention)
- Follow least privilege for file/network access
- Always use `npm ci` in CI/CD pipelines (never `npm install`)
- Pin exact versions in `package.json` (no `^` or `~` prefixes)
- Commit lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `requirements.txt`)
- Do not adopt packages with < 1,000 weekly downloads without explicit user approval
- Do not adopt packages published less than 7 days ago without explicit user approval
