<purpose>
Step 04 of sharded discuss-phase workflow: Write CONTEXT.md capturing all decisions, confirm
creation to user, commit via gsd-tools, update STATE.md, and handle auto-advance to plan-phase.
Final step of the discuss-phase sharded workflow.

Part of Phase 41 SHARD-03 sharding of the 732-line discuss-phase.md monolith.
</purpose>

<step_context>
Read the current StepHandoff via GET /api/steps/discuss-phase/{PHASE} to load context from step-03-discuss.
Required fields from prior handoff: phase_number, phase_name, phase_dir, padded_phase, phase_slug,
decisions, user_inputs, canonical_refs, deferred_ideas, domain_boundary.
</step_context>

<process>

## 1. Write Context

Create CONTEXT.md capturing decisions made.

**Find or create phase directory:**

Use values from init: `phase_dir`, `phase_slug`, `padded_phase`.

If `phase_dir` is null (phase exists in roadmap but no directory):
```bash
mkdir -p ".planning/phases/${padded_phase}-${phase_slug}"
```

**File location:** `${phase_dir}/${padded_phase}-CONTEXT.md`

**Structure the content by what was discussed:**

```markdown
# Phase [X]: [Name] - Context

**Gathered:** [date]
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

[Clear statement of what this phase delivers — the scope anchor]

</domain>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

### [Category 1 that was discussed]
- [Decision or preference captured]
- [Another decision if applicable]

### [Category 2 that was discussed]
- [Decision or preference captured]

### Claude's Discretion
[Areas where user said "you decide" — note that Claude has flexibility here]

</decisions>

<canonical_refs>
## Canonical References

**Downstream agents MUST read these before planning or implementing.**

[MANDATORY section. Write the FULL accumulated canonical refs list here.
Sources: ROADMAP.md refs + REQUIREMENTS.md refs + user-referenced docs during
discussion + any docs discovered during codebase scout. Group by topic area.
Every entry needs a full relative path — not just a name.]

### [Topic area 1]
- `path/to/adr-or-spec.md` — [What it decides/defines that's relevant]
- `path/to/doc.md` §N — [Specific section reference]

### [Topic area 2]
- `path/to/feature-doc.md` — [What this doc defines]

[If no external specs: "No external specs — requirements fully captured in decisions above"]

</canonical_refs>

<code_context>
## Existing Code Insights

### Reusable Assets
- [Component/hook/utility]: [How it could be used in this phase]

### Established Patterns
- [Pattern]: [How it constrains/enables this phase]

### Integration Points
- [Where new code connects to existing system]

</code_context>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

[Any particular references, examples, or "I want it like X" moments from discussion]

[If none: "No specific requirements — open to standard approaches"]

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

[Ideas that came up but belong in other phases. Don't lose them.]

[If none: "None — discussion stayed within phase scope"]

</deferred>

---

*Phase: XX-name*
*Context gathered: [date]*
```

Write file.

## 2. Confirm Creation

Present summary and next steps:

```
Created: .planning/phases/${PADDED_PHASE}-${SLUG}/${PADDED_PHASE}-CONTEXT.md

## Decisions Captured

### [Category]
- [Key decision]

### [Category]
- [Key decision]

[If deferred ideas exist:]
## Noted for Later
- [Deferred idea] — future phase

---

## ▶ Next Up

**Phase ${PHASE}: [Name]** — [Goal from ROADMAP.md]

`/amauta:plan-phase ${PHASE}`

<sub>`/clear` first → fresh context window</sub>

---

**Also available:**
- `/amauta:plan-phase ${PHASE} --skip-research` — plan without research
- Review/edit CONTEXT.md before continuing

---
```

## 3. Git Commit

Commit phase context (uses `commit_docs` from init internally):

```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" commit "docs(${padded_phase}): capture phase context" --files "${phase_dir}/${padded_phase}-CONTEXT.md"
```

Confirm: "Committed: docs(${padded_phase}): capture phase context"

## 4. Update State

Update STATE.md with session info:

```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" state record-session \
  --stopped-at "Phase ${PHASE} context gathered" \
  --resume-file "${phase_dir}/${padded_phase}-CONTEXT.md"
```

Commit STATE.md:

```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" commit "docs(state): record phase ${PHASE} context session" --files .planning/STATE.md
```

## 5. Auto-Advance

Check for auto-advance trigger:

1. Parse `--auto` flag from $ARGUMENTS
2. **Sync chain flag with intent** — if user invoked manually (no `--auto`), clear the ephemeral chain flag from any previous interrupted `--auto` chain. This does NOT touch `workflow.auto_advance` (the user's persistent settings preference):
   ```bash
   if [[ ! "$ARGUMENTS" =~ --auto ]]; then
     node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" config-set workflow._auto_chain_active false 2>/dev/null
   fi
   ```
3. Read both the chain flag and user preference:
   ```bash
   AUTO_CHAIN=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" config-get workflow._auto_chain_active 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
   AUTO_CFG=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" config-get workflow.auto_advance 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
   ```

**If `--auto` flag present AND `AUTO_CHAIN` is not true:** Persist chain flag to config (handles direct `--auto` usage without new-project):
```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" config-set workflow._auto_chain_active true
```

**If `--auto` flag present OR `AUTO_CHAIN` is true OR `AUTO_CFG` is true:**

Display banner:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 AMAUTA ► AUTO-ADVANCING TO PLAN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Context captured. Launching plan-phase...
```

Launch plan-phase using the Skill tool to avoid nested Task sessions (which cause runtime freezes due to deep agent nesting — see #686):
```
Skill(skill="gsd:plan-phase", args="${PHASE} --auto")
```

This keeps the auto-advance chain flat — discuss, plan, and execute all run at the same nesting level rather than spawning increasingly deep Task agents.

**Handle plan-phase return:**
- **PHASE COMPLETE** → Full chain succeeded. Display:
  ```
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   AMAUTA ► PHASE ${PHASE} COMPLETE
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Auto-advance pipeline finished: discuss → plan → execute

  Next: /amauta:discuss-phase ${NEXT_PHASE} --auto
  <sub>/clear first → fresh context window</sub>
  ```
- **PLANNING COMPLETE** → Planning done, execution didn't complete:
  ```
  Auto-advance partial: Planning complete, execution did not finish.
  Continue: /amauta:execute-phase ${PHASE}
  ```
- **PLANNING INCONCLUSIVE / CHECKPOINT** → Stop chain:
  ```
  Auto-advance stopped: Planning needs input.
  Continue: /amauta:plan-phase ${PHASE}
  ```
- **GAPS FOUND** → Stop chain:
  ```
  Auto-advance stopped: Gaps found during execution.
  Continue: /amauta:plan-phase ${PHASE} --gaps
  ```

**If neither `--auto` nor config enabled:**
Route to `confirm_creation` step (existing behavior — show manual next steps).

- STATE.md updated with session info
- User knows next steps

## Produce Final StepHandoff

At the end of this step, save the final StepHandoff via POST /api/steps/discuss-phase/{PHASE}/handoff with next_step=null to signal workflow completion:

```json

  "workflow_name": "discuss-phase",
  "step_id": "step-04-commit",
  "task_id": "{PHASE}-discuss-phase",
  "phase_number": "{PHASE}",
  "completed_steps": ["step-01-scout", "step-02-analyze", "step-03-discuss", "step-04-commit"],
  "context_snapshot": {
    "phase_number": "{phase_number}",
    "phase_name": "{phase_name}",
    "phase_dir": "{phase_dir}",
    "padded_phase": "{padded_phase}"
  },
  "artifacts": {

  },
  "next_step": null,
  "escalation_flags": []
}
```

```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:18799/api/steps/discuss-phase/${PHASE}/handoff" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$HANDOFF_JSON"
```
</step_output>

STOP. Do not proceed to the next step. Save final StepHandoff with next_step=null via POST /api/steps/discuss-phase/{PHASE}/handoff and return control to the workflow router. This is the final step — workflow complete.
